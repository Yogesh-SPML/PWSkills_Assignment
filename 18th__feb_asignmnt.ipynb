A Web API is an interface that is exposed over the web, which allows developers to access the functionality and data of a web application or service. It is used to enable communication between different software applications and services, regardless of the programming language or platform they are built on. Web APIs are widely used in web development to create web services, which can be used by other applications to access data or perform specific tasks. Examples of Web APIs include Google Maps API, Twitter API, and Facebook Graph API."
