The softmax function takes the output of the network and normalizes it so that the sum of the probabilities of all the classes is equal to one.

The update rule involves subtracting a fraction of the gradient from the current value of the parameter, with the fraction being determined by the learning rate.

Vanishing gradients occur when the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases becomes very small, making it difficult to update the parameters of the network. Exploding gradients occur when the gradient becomes very large, causing the parameters to update too much and destabilizing the network. Overfitting occurs when the network becomes too complex and starts to memorize the training data instead of learning to generalize to new data.\n",

        "To address these issues, various techniques have been developed, such as weight initialization, gradient clipping, and regularization. Weight initialization involves setting the initial values of the weights and biases to appropriate values to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients. Gradient clipping involves capping the magnitude of the gradients to avoid exploding gradients. Regularization involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to discourage the network from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data. These techniques can help improve the stability and performance of the network during training."
